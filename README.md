# Road-Network-Analysis

<p>This project is our humble approach to road network analysis for using only unweighted undirected graphs</p>

<p>To run the code please do ensure the dataset (By default: Hosa.csv, you can change it to: (4) Chesapeake.csv as well) and the driver code in 'Project.c' are in the same directory</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>

We have even implemented the fastest path using Dijkstra's algorithm modified for our program (fastestPath function) for weighted graphs, the code for which is given in: `fastestPath.c`
