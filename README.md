# Road-Network-Analysis

<p>This project is our humble approach to road network analysis for using only unweighted undirected graphs</p>

<p>To run the code please do ensure the dataset(By default: Hosa.csv, you can change it to: 4)Chesapeake.csv as well) and the driver code in 'Project.c' are in the same directory</p>

<h2>Note:</h2><p>We have even implemented the fastest path using Dijkstra's algorithm modified for our program(fastestPath function) for weighted garphs, the code for which is gievn in: fastestPath.c</p>
