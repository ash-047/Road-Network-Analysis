# Road-Network-Analysis

<p>The "Road Network Analysis" project is a program designed to analyze and gain insights from road networks represented as undirected graphs. The project provides a set of tools and functionalities for processing road network data, performing graph-based calculations, and helping users understand the properties and characteristics of the network.

Road network data is read from a CSV file, providing flexibility in working with different road network datasets.
</p>

To run the code please do ensure the dataset (By default: `Hosa.csv`, you can change it to: (4) `Chesapeake.csv` as well) and the driver code in `Project.c` are in the same directory

<h2>Note:</h2>

We have even implemented the fastest path using Dijkstra's algorithm modified for our program (fastestPath function) for weighted graphs, the code for which is given in: `fastestPath.c`
